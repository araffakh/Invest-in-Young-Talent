# Niava Team - Robotics Projects

## Overview
Welcome to the **Niava Team** repository! This repository is part of the 'Invest in Young Talent' initiative led by Dr. Khaldon Araffa. The Niava Team is dedicated to building, testing, and improving robotic systems using the Niava platform. Our focus is on practical learning and applying advanced robotics principles in real-world scenarios.

This repository will host our tasks, project documentation, and tutorials as we progress through various phases of development. Each task is designed to challenge team members and enhance their skills in **robotics**, **programming**, **sensors**, and **robot control**.

## Task 1: Basic Communication and Control

### Objective
The goal of Task 1 was to establish basic communication between a **Node.js backend** and an **Arduino** for controlling an LED. We developed a system to control an LED using serial communication via **Node.js**.

### Components Used
- **Arduino UNO**
- **LED**
- **Resistor (220Ω)**
- **Breadboard**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Node.js** for the backend server

### Description
1. **Backend Development**: 
   - A simple **Node.js** application was developed to send serial commands to the Arduino. This allowed us to turn the LED on and off using a web interface.
   
2. **Arduino Setup**:
   - The **Arduino** was connected to an LED and configured to receive commands over the serial port from the **Node.js** server.

3. **Web Interface**:
   - A basic web interface was created to send commands to the Arduino via **Node.js** to toggle the LED on and off.

### Learning Outcomes
- **Arif** worked on developing the **Node.js** backend and web interface.
- **Shahed** developed the **Arduino** sketch to control the LED via serial communication.

## Task 2: Expanded Control with Multiple LEDs and Servo Motor

### Objective
Building on Task 1, the goal of Task 2 is to expand the control system by incorporating multiple LEDs and a servo motor. This will allow more complex robotic behaviors using the Niava platform.

### Components Used
- **Arduino UNO**
- **Multiple LEDs (5 or more)**
- **Resistors (220Ω each)**
- **Servo Motor**
- **Breadboard**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Node.js** for backend server

### Description
1. **Node.js Backend**:
   - The backend will be extended to control multiple LEDs and a servo motor via serial communication.

2. **Arduino Setup**:
   - The **Arduino** will control 5 or more LEDs and a servo motor, receiving commands from the **Node.js** backend.

3. **Web Interface**:
   - The web interface will be expanded to provide control over each LED and servo motor movements.

### Learning Outcomes
- **Arif** will expand the web interface and backend to support multiple devices.
- **Shahed** will modify the **Arduino** sketch to control multiple LEDs and the servo motor.
